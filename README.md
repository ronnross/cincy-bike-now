## Colors
In `tailwind.config.js`, we're using four custom palettes, plus the `trueGray` palette from Tailwind.

The custom palettes were derived from [this generator](http://mcg.mbitson.com/), using the 500-weight seed values from the #23 color scheme in [this list](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/)

```
blue: #4d85bd
green: #7caa2d
yellow: #f5e356
red: #cb6318
```
